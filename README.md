# NYC Citibike Challenge

## Overview of the Analysis

In the following Analysis the data of the Month of August from an existing bike-sharing service in NYC is used and analyzed. The purpose of the analysis is to evaluate whether a similar bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. 


## Results



## Summary 

In summary, the ride-sharing service in Des Moines should be set up to have a maximum of around 30,000 rides per month. The data shows that most of the customers will be annual subscribers. It's import to focus on the main customer group and get profitable with the annual subscriptions. An important insight is also that most of the subscribers are using the sharing service for their commute. It's valuable to figure out how long usually the commute times in Des Moines are and whether it's possible to do it by bike. Most customers are using the sharing service for short trips around 5 - 10 minutes. 

Two additional analyses that can be performed are:

- Distribution locations of the bikes. Start and end location. Interesting whether trucks are necessary to distribute the bikes again through the city.

- Including the age of the users can be interesting to figure out whether enough residents in Des Moines are in the customer group.
